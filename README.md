# ComplexTorusMultiplicationArt
The basic idea here is that we have a finite grid of integer coordinates (a,b) that correspond to a complex number (a + bi). We then wrap the edges into a torus, and then morph it topologically illegally into a sphere. Now we draw a line between (a + bi) and (a + bi)(c + di), where c and d are some arbitrary, modifiable integers, modulo the size of the grid. Taking the midpoints of each line, we can create an awesome mathematical pattern worthy of screensavers everywhere. 

Ok, in order to bask in the glory of this project, one must first download a java ide/graphics library called Processing, in which you can simply open up any one of the 3 .pde's in the folder, and then press play.
