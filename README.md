# ComplexTorusMultiplicationArt
The basic idea here is that we have a finite grid of integer coordinates (a,b) that correspond to a complex number (a + bi). We then wrap the edges into a torus, and then morph it topologically illegally into a sphere. Now we draw a line between (a + bi) and (a + bi)(c + di), modulo the size of the grid. Taking the midpoints of each line, we can create an awesome mathematical pattern worthy of screensavers everywhere.
